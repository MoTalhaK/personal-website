# Personal Portfolio
## Description
Created to showcase the various projects I created in my free time and 
during my undergrad. This was a fun project to take on as I was able to completely 
design thewebsite the way I wanted from the ground up, including the UI/UX and the backend.

## Software
Developed using React.js for the front end and to process emails I used Node.js along with Nodemailer. Bootstrap 
along with some media queries allowed me to make the website fully responsive and provide for a friendly viewing experience.
To deploy the website, I used Firebase along with Firebase functions to handle email requests.
